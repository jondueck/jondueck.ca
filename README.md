jondueck.ca
===========
As I do my work through Collectif, jondueck.ca should have a much more, personal feel.

## Purpose
* Online home page
* Portfolio
* Redirect to [Collectif](http://www.collectif.co)
* Host writing
* Showcase college work, privately or publicly

## Rules
* No mandatory hovers
* All images retina-ready
* Anything that can be .SVG, should be
* Minimal JS
* pixels only for borders
* code must be easy to navigate
* H1, H2, H3 etc must remain the same throughout
* Keep articles narrow, for better legibility
* Quieter, more personal than [collectif.co](collectif.co)
* no `!important`s
* Elements and classes should be as reusable as possible
