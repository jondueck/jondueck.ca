Fixtures is the culmination of spending two years as the in-house designer at Co-op@home.

## Proactive Decision-making
A design system allows me to address the message that needs to be communicated directly without being tied down to make decisions about basic layout, type hierarchy.

## Consistency Across Platforms
The brand appears in a number of different places—from product tags to newspaper ads, coupons to posters, brochures to web pages. A strong language would fit the needs of all those platforms and ensure that the visual voice was the same no matter where you met the brand.

## Cards
Fixtures is primarly seen in Card lockups—a container featuring an image and information.

## Rollout
