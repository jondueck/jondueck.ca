description: Concert photography for the Back 40 Folk Festival's 2014 Those Were the
  Days show.
---

Every year in spring, the Back 40 Folk Festival puts on a sixties-themed show, with a number of local bands covering period artists, as a fundraiser for the festival. In 2014, to celebrate their 25th anniversary, the show featured bands covering artists from 1970–1995. I was asked to shoot some photos for [their website](http://back40folkfest.com).
