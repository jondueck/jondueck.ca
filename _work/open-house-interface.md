At the end of our final year at Red River College, we held an Open House for the public, and for industry members. I was a part of the interface design team along with [Sean Savoie](http://seansavoie.ca/) and [Nicole Vandemosselaer](http://nicolevande.com/). We were tasked with creating an interactive class portfolio that would be displayed on a number of iMacs. I created the final mock-ups of the site—shown below—as well as coded part of the site.

Built in HTML and SASS. Mock-ups in Adobe Illustrator.
