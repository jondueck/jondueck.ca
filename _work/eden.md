description: Web development for Eden Healthcare Services.

Eden Health Care Services is a mental health and wellness organization in Manitoba. When I was approached about a redesign of their website, they had three separate news blogsâ€”each hosted on a unique Blogspot site. So, along with a visual redesign, the new site brought together their publications into one website. Now Eden had a unified experience for people to visit.
