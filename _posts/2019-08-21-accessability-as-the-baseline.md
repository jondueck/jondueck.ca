Some sharp writing from [Robin Rendle](https://www.robinrendle.com) for [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/accessibility-and-web-performance-are-not-features-theyre-the-baseline/).

> Instead we must start to see inaccessible and slow websites for what they are: a form of cruelty. And if we want to build a web that is truly a World Wide Web, a place for all and everyone, a web that is accessible and fast for as many people as possible, and one that will outlive us all, then first we must make our websites something else altogether; we must make them kind.
