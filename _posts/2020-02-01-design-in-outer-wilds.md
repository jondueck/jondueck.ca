Recently I picked up *Outer Wilds*, a space exploration game by Mobius Digital and published by Annapurna Interactive.

Let's start with the logo, designed by [Cory Schmitz](https://coryschmitz.com/Game-Logos) who contributed both logo design and 2D graphic design to the project. The logo is heavily-modified versions of ITC's [Avant Garde](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/avant-garde-gothic/) for "Outer" in Medium weight and ITC's [Serif Gothic](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/serif-gothic/) for "Wilds" in Roman weight.
