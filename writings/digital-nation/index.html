	<p>I’m currently finishing up my final year of studying Digital Media Design at Red River College in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. In my Visual Explorations class we watched the Douglas Rushkoff documentary <em>Digital Nation</em> and were then tasked with creating a five-minute presentation answering the question “What does it mean to be human in an increasingly digital world?”</p>

<p>We were asked to share about:</p>

<ul>
<li>The world we were born into</li>
<li>The technological/social changes that have occurred within our lifetime</li>
<li>Our future at home, and at work</li>
</ul>

<p>So these are my notes for the presentation, structured in a way that fit the assignment.</p>

<h2>The world I was born into</h2>

<p>I was born in 1994, so I represent the youngest segment of the class. In 1994, the Internet was just gaining mainstream traction. People were learning about logging on and discovering electronic mail. The Internet was a mysterious new form of communication connecting users across the globe. People wondered if one day everyone would be “logged on.”</p>

<p>Our first computer was a black and white computer that my aunt and uncle gave us, so my experience with the Internet started years later. If I remember correctly, the first website I visited was nhl.com, on a computer at the Manitoba Museum in Winnipeg. When we got our Windows XP computer, it didn’t take long for me to turn my hobby of drawing into computer artwork. I used the Internet to learn how to create</p>

<p>The technological/social changes that have occurred within my lifetime In the early days of the Internet, the main purpose was communication. In 1994 sixty percent of web traffic was e-mail. However, besides e-mail, there wasn’t a lot of user interaction. One could view pages for businesses or Space Jam, but the library of pages was curated by those who understood the language of code, or by those who could afford to hire those who understood. There was a gap between the builders of the Internet and the users.</p>

<p>With Web 2.0 though, users and builders began to work together to build the internet. For the average user, the Internet was no longer someone else’s world that they could explore, but a place where they could now add their own creation. Users could create pages about themselves, blogs about their favourite recipes or forums where they could meet people who liked the same television show. Creatives could share their work. Craftsmen could build an audience for their products. The playing field was levelled as small businesses now had the oppurtunity to reach customers from all over the world. And, of course, the social network blurred the lines between real and digital life.</p>

<p>Your future at home, and at work The future is a hard thing to predict. Technology is moving so fast that you can hardly imagine something before it’s already in production. Still, I know that technology will continue to play a greater and greater role in our lives. The home grows increasingly digital and connected. Our smoke detectors allow us to check carbon monoxide levels from our phone and our lightbulbs alert us when someone likes our Facebook status. For better or worse, our homes are becoming as digital as the rest of our life.</p>

<p>At work, tools will continue to improve. Coding languages will be updated. Internet Explorer will probably always slow down web development. </p>

<p>I was reading <a href="">Ash Huang’s</a> article <a href=""><em>Tiny gods</em></a> in Offscreen Magazine, and she said this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At its best, the web’s powerful and sexy. It makes us feel like tiny gods again. But, the aluminium and plastic shells are really just membranes. To create meaningful worlds and solve wicked problems, we have to be children of the real world. We have to love, hate, laugh and cry like the wild animals that we are. We have to surprise one another.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I liked that. She writes about creating the web, and how we’re trying to improve life through that. We’re building websites where people can track their ancestry, or share photos, or read stories, or share secrets. I think that applies to video games or motion graphics or videography as well. Though we create the digital world, hopefully we’re trying to build a better world beyond the screen.</p>

<p>Ash goes on to say that computers are built to perform specific tasks, and to do that predictably. However, real change, real innovation, comes from human creativity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We try to replicate nature and improve on it, and often we succeed. But unlike us, our machines don’t improve with natural acts of randomness. They break. If not for safeties, they would crash cars and space stations. The surprises that make nature so lovely and interesting don’t transfer to machines.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I like to think of it as a reminder. These wondrous machines we control are powerful but they are not complete. We count on them to do our bidding and ease our lives, but we are the only ones who can produce startling change with them. They are closed systems that respond to our revelations.</p>

<p>The digital world and the natural world continue to grow together. So as the two blend into each other, lets build the digital world not to distract, not to get in the way and not to replace the natural world, but to enhance, protect and inspire it.</p>
