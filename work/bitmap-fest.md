Bitmap Fest is a fictional film festival “held” at Red River College. The assignment was to create a series of film posters for movies from 1983—Flashdance, WarGames and Scarface. We were provided with two to three black & white images per poster and could use one. All type except for the A headings had to be set in the same face, size and weight.

I decided to make a series of posters based on creating a pattern with the image. From a distance, the posters all look fairly similar, but up close the posters are made up of unique images.
