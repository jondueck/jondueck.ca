## Movies of the Year

<!-- ![](https://scenebygreen.files.wordpress.com/2023/09/vs-youtube-pastlivesofficialtrailerhda24-126.png) -->

This was a big year for me for movies. I watched [fourteen feature-length films from 2023](https://letterboxd.com/jondueck/films/diary/for/2023/year/2023/) in 2023, as well as one feature documentary, and four short films – including [eight at the cinema](https://letterboxd.com/jondueck/tag/cinema/films/year/2023/). That’s the most movies I’ve watched in their release year ever, I believe. For me, there’s a strong top five, and then the rest – but they’re all good. [I still missed a lot of good ones](https://letterboxd.com/jondueck/watchlist/year/2023/).


1. [_Oppenheimer_](https://letterboxd.com/film/oppenheimer-2023/)<!--<br>Christopher Nolan playing to all of his strengths, held together tightly by Jennifer Lame’s precision editing.-->
2. [_Killers of the Flower Moon_](https://letterboxd.com/film/killers-of-the-flower-moon/)<!--<br>A movie so gripping that we all stayed in the cinema for 3½ hours with horrible speakers. A powerful ending.-->
3. [_Past Lives_](https://letterboxd.com/film/past-lives/)<br><!--A tender and mature debut-->
4. [_Asteroid City_](https://letterboxd.com/film/asteroid-city/)
5. [_The Boy and The Heron_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-boy-and-the-heron/) or _How Do You Live?_
6. [_The Holdovers_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-holdovers/)
7. [_Showing Up_](https://letterboxd.com/film/showing-up-2022/)
8. [_Blackberry_](https://letterboxd.com/film/blackberry-2023/)
9. [_Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part 1_](https://letterboxd.com/film/mission-impossible-dead-reckoning-part-one/)
10. [_Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse_](https://letterboxd.com/film/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse/)
11. [_Napoléon_](https://letterboxd.com/film/napoleon-2023/)
12. [_The Killer_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-killer-2023/)
13. [_The Creator_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-creator-2023/)<br><!--I thought that this would finish near the top for me, but unfortunately the script doesn’t live up to the cinematography, production design, and special effects.-->
14. [_Barbie_](https://letterboxd.com/film/barbie/)<!--<br>Greta Gerwig gets far more out of a movie about dolls than should have been possible. -->

1. [*Blank Check*](https://www.blankcheckpod.com/podcast) by Griffin Newman and David Sims <br>The perfect mix of funny and insightful

<h2 id="videogames">Video Games Played this Year</h2>

A year in which I didn’t do as much total gaming, but I added a [Playdate](https://play.date) and was gifted an Anbernic RG353V.

These games were started and/or completed in 2023:

- [*The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom*](https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/store/products/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-switch/) (**2023**) – Nintendo Switch
- [New York Times Crosswords](https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords)
- [*Recommendation Dog*](https://play.date/games/recommendation-dog/) – Playdate
- Casual Birder – Playdate
- *Nine Parchments* (2017) – Nintendo Switch

### Bonus Round
- **Favourite Soundtrack of 2023**: *The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom* by Manaka Kataoka, Tsukasa Usui, Maasa Miyoshi, and Masato Ohashi
- **“Favourite compliment you’ve received from a video game”** (asked by Tim): *I couldn’t figure out an answer for this one. Sorry Tim.*
- **“Favourite stream on Twitch ~~that you also know IRL~~”** (asked by [Tim](https://www.twitch.tv/timmyisonline)): [timmyisonline](https://www.twitch.tv/timmyisonline)

## Miscellanea

- **Favourite Coffee** (asked by Tim): I drank a lot of [Other Brother’s natural Ethiopian coffee from Uraga, Guji](https://www.otherbrotherroasters.com/collections/filter-drip-roast/products/ethiopia-uraga) – hot, iced, espresso, V60, Chemex. I’m drinking it as I write this.
- **“Favourite group of friends to play video games with on some Thursdays”** (asked by Tim): [Johnnie, Tim, and Ty](https://twitter.com/html5head/status/1433805227858153473/photo/1)
- **“Top emoji of the year”** (asked by Josiah):
  - By use (estimated): 😬 🤷 👍 
  - By favourites: 🤦 🕴️ 🌮
- **“Something you and/or culture Rediscovered, or Got Back Into this past year”** (asked by Nathan): The answer should be blogging, but I fell off after a strong start this year. Movies? I think that answer works for both me and culture. I watched more new releases than ever, I took an afternoon off to Barb’ and ’enheimer at the local cinema, and I watched two movies away from my hometown. Meanwhile, “culture” disregarded long-time major franchises, while movies for adults like _Oppenheimer_ and _Killers of the Flower Moon_ performed better than would have been expected and Miyazaki had his first North American number one movie.
- **Favourite Tabletop Game of 2023**: [Snakes of Wrath by Weast Coast](https://snakesofwrath.com/) was the only new tabletop game that I played, but it’s good.
