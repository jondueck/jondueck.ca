I recently made [Alison Roman’s “Cheesy, Salty, Savory Scones”](https://www.alisoneroman.com/recipes/cheesy-salty-savory-scones/) from *Sweet Enough* and they were a huge hit. Enough that I got a request to make them again. However, in order for everyone in the next group to enjoy them, I needed to modify them to be dairy-free. 

Replacing 3 dairy ingredients at the same time made me nervous enough that I made a backup snack to bring, but they turned out every bit as good as the originals. They tasted great and people were suprised that they were dairy-free.

Replacements:
| Original | Ratio | Replacement |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Sour Cream | 1:1 volume | Plant-Based Sour Cream Alternative |
| Heavy Cream | 1:1 volume | Plant-Based Protein Milk |
| Cheese | 1:1 weight | Vegan Mozzarella |

For the sour cream, I used [President’s Choice plant-based sour cream alternative](https://www.realcanadiansuperstore.ca/en/plant-based-sour-cream-alternative/p/21369455_EA). 

For the heavy cream, I used Silk unsweetened almond and cashew protein milk.

For the grated parmesan or pecorino cheese I used  Violife dairy-free mozzarella shreds, further crumbled by hand.

None of this is groundbreaking, but I’m posting this so that anyone searching for *alison roman cheesy salty savory scones vegan* can find that someone has already tried this and it works. I’ll update this post as I make these more often.

Additional note: I like to dice up a jalapeño and mix it in to the dough instead of the leeks in the recipe.
