I’m still trying to figure the best way to share links with this blog. [Josh Ginter’s The Newsprint has a separate “Fresh Links” section](https://thenewsprint.co/fresh-links/) dedicated to this. [kottke.org](https://kottke.org) has links mixed in with other posts. [Noah Jacobus has his “Enjoyment Roundup” series](https://noahjacob.us/words/roundup-002.html), first started on Twitter, where he posts a regular format “whenever [he has] experienced enough different things across various media that pique [his] interest.” 

Do I include these links in the main RSS feed, or an optional second feed?

Here is my first attempt at a solution: a collection of links from the past month. A few to read, a few to listen to, and a few to watch. Pick and choose whichever links sound interesting. We’ll find out on 28 February if this sticks.
