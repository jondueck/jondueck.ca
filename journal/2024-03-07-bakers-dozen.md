> No cheating – your Quietus style Baker’s Dozen. 13 albums (off the top of your head) to know you by. Not looking for a perfect list, looking for a list that you instantly regret posting because you then remember something else.

Does it mean the best way to [a timeline of my history](https://www.last.fm/user/dueckjon/library/albums?date_preset=ALL)? [Where I’m at right now](https://www.last.fm/user/dueckjon/library/albums?from=2023-03-07&to=2024-03-07&page=1)? In the spirit of James’ request, “off the top of your head” , here’s the first thirteen that came to mind.

Surely I will “instantly regret” this list, but that’s in the spirit of the request. I would like to revisit this with more condsideration in the future, though.
