I’ve wanted to make a Twitter bot that tweets horse_ebooks-esque nonsense based on my personal tweets for a while. It took six years from the creation of the account until I had a working bot. [@botdueck](https://twitter.com/botdueck) is finally live.

The bot takes the content of my previous personal tweets and remixes them into new posts, via [Markov chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain#Markov_text_generators).

This was my first time making anything of this sort and it’s all thanks to [Tom Meagher’s heroku_ebooks](https://github.com/tommeagher/heroku_ebooks) repo. With Tom’s guide and a lot of trial and error, I was able to get the Twitter API working, and set up a worker on heroku to automatically post every now and then.

Follow, if you’d like. I can’t guarantee the quality.
