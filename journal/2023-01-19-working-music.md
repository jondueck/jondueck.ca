*Post 3/3 as a part of [Bring Back Blogging](https://bringback.blog).* üéâ

Yesterday in the office, we talked about the music that we listen to while working. If I‚Äôm writing code or thinking in language, I tend to favour instrumental or ambient music. If the work is a bit more external and visual, like layout and design, then I‚Äôm open to a variety.

Here are a few albums that have been in my rotation at the office:

- [*Anyhow*](https://lelandwhitty.bandcamp.com/album/anyhow-2) by Leeland Whitty
- [*Love In Us All*](https://youtu.be/6ZW0xvo_DB0) by Pharoah Sanders
- [*Sable (Original Video Game Soundtrack)*](https://youtu.be/9KOPEhoZF8I) by Japanese Breakfast
- [*Komachi*](https://metronrecords.bandcamp.com/album/komachi) by Meitei
- [*Promises*](https://floatingpoints.bandcamp.com/album/promises) by Floating Points, Pharoah Sanders, London Symphony Orchestra
- [*Space 1.8*](https://nalasinephro.bandcamp.com/album/space-18) by Nala Sinephro (+ [*Live at Real World Studios*](https://nalasinephro.bandcamp.com/album/live-at-real-world-studios-with-edward-wakili-hick-dwayne-kilvington))

I tend to select albums most often, but when I can‚Äôt think of any in particular, I have a few regular playlists to fall back on. Some of the ones listed here are a style of playlist that I differentiate as a ‚Äúcollection‚Äù. They aren‚Äôt built with a regular playlist structure. The songs aren‚Äôt in any particular order, and often they contain full albums or large portions. ‚ÄúCollections‚Äù are meant to be listened to in shuffle order.

For Apple Music users, Apple curates a playlist that I enjoyed listening to, called [*New Latitudes*](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/new-latitudes/pl.54600a132bfc42cb82858e781d0046aa). <!--I had begun porting these Spotify playlists over to Apple Music, but unfortunately when my Apple Music trial ended, it wiped out all of the playlists in my library.-->
