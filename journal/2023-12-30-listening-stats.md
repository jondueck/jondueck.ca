Once again, this year’s listening was a mix of Apple Music (the app), Apple Music (the service), and Spotify. As my own alternative to Spotify Wrapped/Apple Music Replay, here’s my listening data from all services, via [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/dueckjon/).


I listened to approximately [612 different artists](https://www.last.fm/user/dueckjon/library/artists?from=2023-01-01&to=2023-12-31), [902 different albums](https://www.last.fm/user/dueckjon/library/albums?from=2023-01-01&to=2023-12-31), and [3032 different songs](https://www.last.fm/user/dueckjon/library/tracks?from=2023-01-01&to=2023-12-31) for a total of [5921 plays](https://www.last.fm/user/dueckjon/library?from=2023-01-01&to=2023-12-31), [up 32% from last year](https://www.last.fm/user/dueckjon/listening-report/year). That’s about 259 hours of listening.

Like last year, I’m ordering these lists by playtime. I belive it’s the way that Spotify orders their lists, and I think that it’s a more accurate feel for my listening that ordering by playcount. I’ve used [Patrick McDonough’s last.timer tool](https://pmcdonough8133.github.io/last.timer/) to analyze my most-played artists and songs by playtime. ([@undefinist’s lasttime tool](https://undefinist.com/lasttime/) looked promising, but when I tested against some manually-calculated data it had a few errors.) A goal for next year is to build on these two tools to create a new version that will do both of these for me using Last.fm scrobbles and MusicBrainz duration data.
