It’s been a h*ck of a year, but there was some nice media to help me get through it.

## Podcasts of the Year
Based on episodes released in the year 2020.

0. *Stay F. Homekins* – Paul F Tompkins & Janie Haddad Tompkins<br>A welcome companion through this year. I guess it's a good thing that this show might end sometime this coming year, but it's kind of sad too.
0. *Reply All* – PJ Vogt & Alex Goldman<br>From QAn*n to trying to find a song that you heard in the grocery store, Reply All is still the best at understanding the internet.
0. *Front Burner* – CBC<br>In a year of quick-moving news, Front Burner was a handy, digestible way to stay informed without getting to caught up in it all.
0. *Comedy Bang! Bang!* – Scott Aukerman (+ Cal Solomon, August Lindt, Darren Matichek, Max Keeper, etc)<br>Despite the challenges of producing this kind of show remotely, it was as funny as ever. As proof, listen to the _Best of 2020_ Episodes
0. *Young Adult Movie Ministry* – Alissa Wilkinson & Sam Thielman<br>It's kind of like _Good Christian Fun_ but a tad more serious?

## Video Games of the Year
2020 was the year that I finally bought a Nintendo Switch. I had been wanting to play *Breath of the Wild* since it came out, but it took Public Health telling me to stay at home before I actually bought a Switch. I only played 2 games from 2020, so this list is 2020 games first, followed by other games I started this year – in no particular order.

- *Animal Crossing: New Horizons* (2020) – Nintendo Switch<br>The first game I bought for my Switch. The perfect game for this year.
- *Ghost of Tsushima* (2020) – PS4<br>The first AAA RPG I’ve played on PS4. This game has beautiful lighting.
- *Outer Wilds* (2019) – PS4<br>The first game that I got into during the early days of staying at home. Quirky and enjoyable.
- *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild* (2017) – Nintendo Switch<br>Late to this one. Not the first to say this one is great.
- *FIFA 21* (2020) – PS4<br>I just like playing FIFA, ok?

## Books of the Year
[I read 23 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2020/5173121) in 2020. One short of my goal of 24. I read a few books from 2019, but only two books from 2020 – *The Skin We're In* by Desmond Cole and *Why We're Polarized* by Ezra Klein.

<!-- - *The Skin We’re In* (2020) by Desmond Cole
- *Why We’re Polarized* (2020) by Ezra Klein
- *Trick Mirror* (2019) by Jia Tolentino
- *The Mezzanine* (1988) by Nicholson Baker
- *The Hobbit* (1937) by JRR Tolkien
- *Recursion* (2019) by Blake Crouch
- *The Lathe of Heaven* (1971) by Ursula K Le Guin
- *Dune* (1965) by Frank Herbert -->

## Movies of the Year

I tracked [4 films from 2020](https://letterboxd.com/jondueck/films/year/2020/): one musical and two standup specials. So I don't think I’ll rank them. [_Palm Springs_](https://letterboxd.com/film/palm-springs-2020/) ends up in first place by default. I’ll try to do better next year.
