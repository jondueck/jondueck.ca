After seeing friends sharing their Spotify Wrappeds, and Apple Music Replays, I joked on Twitter: 

> I’d like to see Paprika Wrapped. I want to know which recipes my friends have been cooking most this year.

[Paprika](https://www.paprikaapp.com), here, is the recipe management app that I use on MacOS and iOS. I think it’s a little funny to imagine their take on Spotify Wrapped, but I also sincerely think that it would be interesting to see which dishes my friends are making the most often.

I have no real way of knowing which recipes were my most frequently-cooked, but here are a few of my regulars that I went for in the kitchen this year.

## [Two-Hour Weeknight Pizza](https://www.ethanchlebowski.com/cooking-techniques-recipes/how-to-make-2-hour-weeknight-pizza)
Recipe by Ethan Chlebowski

While this recipe has started to be replaced by [Ooni’s _Classic Pizza Dough_](https://ooni.com/blogs/recipes/classic-pizza-dough-how-to-make-it-perfect), Ethan’s recipe was the recipe I used for most of the year.

## [Sheet Pan Bibimbap](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022131-sheet-pan-bibimbap)
Recipe by Eric Kim for the New York Times

Easy and flexible. I often made this after grocery shopping – putting away the groceries while the vegetables roasted.

## [Grilled Chicken Club Sandwich](https://www.ethanchlebowski.com/cooking-techniques-recipes/grilled-chicken-club-sando)

## [Masa Pancakes](https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/masa-pancakes-alan-delgado)
Recipe by Alan Delgado of Xilonen for Epicurious

A great twist on pancakes. The masa adds a nice bit of floral freshness. I liked getting the masa started first thing in the morning, going for a walk around the neighbourhood, and then coming back to make the pancakes.


## [BA’s Best Chocolate Chip Cookies](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/bas-best-chocolate-chip-cookies)
Recipe by Chris Morocco for Bon Appétit

My go-to cookie the last two or three years. Takes a bit of extra time with browning the butter, but really not too much work. A big hit with my friends.
