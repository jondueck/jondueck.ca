Yesterday, I went to my first concert in a few years. Alvvays, the band behind my [2022 Album of the Year](/journal/2022/bests-of-2022/), [played at the Burton Cummings Theatre in Winnipeg](https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/alvvays/2023/burton-cummings-theatre-winnipeg-mb-canada-43ba4ba7.html).

I’ve been following Alvvays since I first heard [_Archie, Marry Me_](https://youtu.be/ZAn3JdtSrnY) on [CBC Radio 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBC_Radio_3#Webcast). That song has turned into probably a top-5 song for me, and they’ve only grown since that record. They’ve been my most-played artist by a considerable margin since they released [_Blue Rev_](https://alvvays.bandcamp.com/album/blue-rev) this past October.

It was a joy to see these songs that have gotten me through the winter played live. Just as special was experiencing it with a friend I hadn’t seen in a while. I’d like to highlight a song or two, but the entire set was incredible.

If you haven’t heard Alvvays live, [check out the live session they recorded for KEXP earlier this year](https://youtu.be/6647smeduGI).
