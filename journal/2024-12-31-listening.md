I listened to approximately [1010 different artists](https://www.last.fm/user/dueckjon/library/artists?from=2024-01-01&to=2024-12-31), [1490 different albums](https://www.last.fm/user/dueckjon/library/albums?from=2024-01-01&to=2024-12-31), and [6357 different songs](https://www.last.fm/user/dueckjon/library/tracks?from=2024-01-01&to=2024-12-31) for a total of [10,938 plays](https://www.last.fm/user/dueckjon/library?from=2024-01-01&to=2024-12-31), [up about 85% from last year](https://www.last.fm/user/dueckjon/listening-report/year). That’s about 689 hours of listening.

I track my listening through [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/dueckjon). ~~This year’s lists were calculated using a custom fork of [@undefinist’s Last Time](https://undefinist.com/lasttime/) web app, passing my Last.fm listening data through MusicBrainz for track durations. I had hoped to build my own tool this year, but it was a bigger task than I had time for. There were some issues with missing data with the original version of the tool, so I also used my previous pick, [Patrick McDonough’s last.timer](https://pmcdonough8133.github.io/last.timer/) as cross-reference. In the end, it still involved a lot of verification by hand. By the end of *next* year, I hope to have built a new tool to run these stats for me.~~ A few days after I posted this, I showed [Josiah](https://jwie.be) my cobbled-together version of the tool I was using to collate the data and talked him through my continuing issues. By the next morning, he had [built a webapp](https://jwie.be/playground/lastfm) that did more than my tool and did it better. I’ve updated the stats from the original version of this post in the spirit of accuracy. Thanks, Josiah!
