## Albums of the Year

I only [listened to 52 albums this year](https://www.last.fm/user/dueckjon/listening-report/year). I’m not sure why my total was so low this year. This list is probably the least settled of any that I’ve ever published here. For more detailed listening statistics from this year, see my [2022 Listening Stats post](/journal/2022/listening-stats/).
