Last year, [Noah Jacobus wrote about his drafts](https://noahjacob.us/words/writing-in-the-open) to share what he was thinking about while starting his blog. I borrowed that idea for [my own post](/journal/2023/potential-posts/) about unfinished drafts. Unfortunately, I went 0/8 on publishing them – some lost their timeliness, others I forgot about.

Here are five unfinished drafts from the past year. If I can publish one of these it will be an improvement over last year.

- **“Reasons I Started Counselling”** (February 2023)– Six points that convinced me to sign up for counselling
- **“Behaving For the Machines”** (March 2023) – Have you ever opened a private browsing tab to search for some piece of trivia, not because it was improper, but just because you didn’t want some ad tracker to link that topic to you?
- **“Dream Covers”** (March 2023) – My imagined pairings of songs and artists that I think would have an interesting interpretation of those songs.
- **“The most helpful advice I recieved about video games”** (June 2023) – On using Easy Mode, not to be a lesser gamer, but to be a way into video games.
- **“Triplicate Posting”** (July 2023) – Started just after the launch of Threads. On the post-Twitter fracturing of social media for me and how I’ve noticed myself posting less and using Mastodon/Twitter/Threads more for links.

If any of these sound interesting to you, let me know.
