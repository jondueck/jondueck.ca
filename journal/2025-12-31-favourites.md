Every year, I like to put out my lists of favourites. I always enjoy reading others’ end-of-year posts ([1](https://www.seeingthroughfilm.com/p/the-best-stuff-i-found-in-2025), [2](https://www.noexpectations.fyi/p/the-100-best-albums-of-2025), for example) and hope to add a few of my favourites to the conversation.

1. [*Getting Killed*](https://record.club/releases/albums/geese-getting-killed) by Geese <br><span class="note">What’s left to say about this album that hasn’t been said by smarter writers than me? A fun album to try to sing along to in the car while driving back from an autumn hike.</span>
2. [*Tonky*](https://record.club/releases/albums/lonnie-holley-tonky) by Lonnie Holley <br><span class="note">From the opening track that immediately to the beautiful, reflective *Did I Do Enough?* this is a powerful record.</span>
3. [*Face Down in the Garden*](https://record.club/releases/albums/tennis-face-down-in-the-garden) by Tennis<br><span class="note">An all-time great night driving record. A strong finale with a final track that feels like it encompasses the entirety of the band’s run. RIP</span>
