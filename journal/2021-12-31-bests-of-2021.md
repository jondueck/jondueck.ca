## Video Games of the Year*
I only played two games released in 2021, so these are my favourite games that I played this year. I made an effort to finish more games this year. I still left *Breath of the Wild*, *Outer Wilds*, and *Ghost of Tsushima* unfinished, so you can probably expect to see those titles on this list next year.

- *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild* (2017) – Nintendo Switch<br>My friends convinced me to start going after bosses and trying to b
- *The Gardens In Between* (2018) – Nintendo Switch<br>Lovely little puzzle game. The ideal game to play before bed, and I mean that in the best way possible.
- *Stardew Valley* (2016) – Steam<br>
- *Donut County* (2018) – Nintendo Switch
- *For the King* (2017) - Nintendo Switch, Steam
- *Florence* (2020) – Nintendo Switch
- *[Windsor Road](https://everydaylouie.itch.io/windsor-road)* (2021) – GB Rom/Itch.io
- *Picross S2* (2018) – Nintendo Switch
- *Knockout City* (2021) – Nintendo Switch/PS4<br>Enjoyed this game with friends. You can play for quite a while for free. I enjoyed it enough to purchase a year of EA Play, but eventually my friends levelled up beyond the free limit and I ran out of teammates.
