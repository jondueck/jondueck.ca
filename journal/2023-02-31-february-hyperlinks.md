In case you missed February, here’s the second edition of my collection of links from the month. It’s a habit now. 

A few weeks ago, [Yannick Schutz wrote the first blog post that mentions one of my blog posts](https://yannickschutz.com/hyperliens/). That was a special moment for me. *Merci, Yannick*. He also shared some thoughts with me about sharing links, and I hope to have more to say on that shortly.

Here’s February 2023:
