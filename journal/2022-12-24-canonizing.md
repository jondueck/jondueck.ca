> “What are five songs where it Just Isn’t Christmas if you haven’t heard them?”

This was a question that [Nathan](https://blog.interestingtimes.ca/2022/12/15/canonizing/) asked me, and [asked himself on his blog](https://blog.interestingtimes.ca/2022/12/15/canonizing/). He gave me a secondary challenge of limiting my list to only one Sufjan Stevens song, knowing that the list would only be one artist otherwise.

## “Christmas in the Room” or “Only At Christmas Time” by Sufjan Stevens

From the beginning, I’m cheating, but it’s very hard to pick _just one_ Sufjan Stevens Christmas song. Across his two official collections, he’s published 100 Christmas songs that span every emotion of the season. 

[*Christmas in the Room*](https://sufjanstevens.bandcamp.com/track/christmas-in-the-room-2) is always the first of his tracks that I put on when I decide that it is indeed Christmas Music Season. [*Only at Christmas Time*](https://sufjanstevens.bandcamp.com/track/only-at-christmas-time) is more spiritual – written in a way that feels understandable as a whole, but becomes mysterious when examined line-by-line.

Maybe I’ll write more one day about Stevens’ role in my Chrsitmas canon but [Tyler Huckabee recently wrote about how his music captures an authentic Christmas spirit](https://tylerhuckabee.substack.com/p/ill-have-a-bad-christmas-thats-certain): 

> Other artists treat Christmas schmaltziness as an obstacle to overcome, but Sufjan embraces it. (…) Slapdash orchestras, one-take singalongs and grand yuletide symphonies with the seams showing. (…) This is, to me, as close to the spirit of Christmas as humans are likely to get.

## “Christmastime is Here” by Vince Guaraldi Trio
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=807688521/size=small/linkcol=0687f5/track=1478098172/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://vinceguaraldi.bandcamp.com/album/a-charlie-brown-christmas-remastered-expanded-edition">A Charlie Brown 
Christmas: Remastered &amp; Expanded Edition by Vince Guaraldi Trio</a></iframe>

Vince Guaraldi has a Bandcamp page? _A Charlie Brown Christmas_ has long been my go-to Christmas movie. The whole record is great, but [this track](https://vinceguaraldi.bandcamp.com/track/christmas-time-is-here-instrumental) especially suspends you in Christmas spirit. 


I’m glad to see [this made Nathan’s list](https://blog.interestingtimes.ca/2022/12/15/canonizing/) as well.

## “Xmas Curtain” by My Morning Jacket
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1534053455/size=small/linkcol=0687f5/track=1217300565/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://mmorningjacket.bandcamp.com/album/my-morning-jacket-does-xmas-fiasco-style">My Morning Jacket Does Xmas Fiasco Style by My Morning Jacket</a></iframe>

[Their version from _My Morning Jacket Does Xmas Fiasco Style_](https://mmorningjacket.bandcamp.com/track/xmas-curtain), specifically. The first three tracks of their Christmas record have such an easy-going melancholy style.

## “In the Bleak Midwinter” by Bombay Bicycle Club

[YouTube](https://youtu.be/ZTkW09o7a9c?t=4)

One of my favourite classic Christmas carols. This was the first Christmas song that I listened to this year. In Manitoba, midwinter is indeed bleak. Bombay Bicycle’s version with Liz Lawrence for BBC Radio 1 is perfectly tender with some beautiful breathy horns.

I do wish we could hear Jack Steadman’s delivery of the line “Our God, Heaven cannot hold Him” with the scotch snaps in the middle, but that verse didn’t make the cut.

## “The Christmas Waltz” by Sleeping At Last

[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/5UhLEgHEH7njjDMWEPoktS?si=0e6b3a2362304c1c) / [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/ca/album/the-christmas-waltz/1298273516?i=1298275170]) / [YouTube](https://youtu.be/tssdnou08Dg)

My 20<sup>th</sup> century classic pick for this list. This cover, specifically, is gentle, lonely, sweet, and hopeful.
