It’s hard to admit that it’s time to start on a fall playlist. We’ve had an unusually gentle transition to autumn here.

New records from Alvvays (_[Blue Rev](https://alvvays.bandcamp.com/album/blue-rev)_) and Alex G (_[God Save The Animals](https://sandy.bandcamp.com/album/god-save-the-animals)_) seem perfectly timed for inclusion in this season. Earlier releases, like Big Thief’s _[Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe In You](https://bigthief.bandcamp.com/album/dragon-new-warm-mountain-i-believe-in-you)_ from February and Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith & Emile Mosseri’s _[I Could Be Your Dog/I Could Be Your Moon](https://kaitlynaureliasmith.bandcamp.com/album/i-could-be-your-dog-i-could-be-your-moon)_ from May, may be even better in this season.

I’ve tried to make selections that still maintain a little hope through the cooling weather, a little warmth for comfort, and some cooler tunes.

The playlist is still in progress, but you can listen to it on [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/ca/playlist/fall-2022-wip/pl.u-XkEJU4Y5PvP) or [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/5WO3XC0JXnH9PmFNQTHPpL?si=TOotoG32Q1ukPsoeSvACuw). [Tweet at me](https://twitter.com/jondueck) if you have any other suggestions.

I shot the cover photo in September around Lake Minnewasta on iPhone X.
