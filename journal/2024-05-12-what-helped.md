> The day after I had counted down all of your breaths
> Down until there were none, were none, were none, were none
> A hummingbird crashed right in front of me and I understood all you did for us
> You gave, and gave, and gave, and gave

At the end of 2023, my Mom passed away after her second bout with cancer. I haven’t mentioned it online because I can’t seem to quite put the words around it in the way I would want to for the internet. I don’t have a tribute ready to publish yet, but I do have some resources that helped me through grief. 

Beyond the immense help of friends, family, and my counsellor, the single most impactful resource was the book [*It’s OK That You're Not OK* by Megan Devine](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34303824-it-s-ok-that-you-re-not-ok). It’s honest yet caring.

My counsellor also recommended that I look to grief in music and movies, so here are a few that I connected with:

- The album, *Letters to Lost Loves* by Tyson Motsenbocker – especially [*Honest*](https://youtu.be/9s0OXNJzHXE)
- The album, [*Mercy* by Natalie Bergman](https://nataliebergman.bandcamp.com/album/mercy)
- The song, [*Colombia* by Local Natives](https://youtu.be/hJ0khpACShA?t=42) or [the eight-minute demo](https://soundcloud.com/local-natives/colombia-8-minute-demo)
- The music of Sufjan Stevens, especially songs like [*Casimir Pulaski Day*](https://sufjanstevens.bandcamp.com/track/casimir-pulaski-day) or the albums [Carrie & Lowell](https://sufjanstevens.bandcamp.com/album/carrie-lowell) or [Javelin](https://sufjanstevens.bandcamp.com/album/javelin)
- The album, [*My Dad Died* by Justice Cow](https://justicecow.bandcamp.com/album/my-dad-died)
- The album [*12* by Ryuichi Sakamoto](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvsYXqtYjMYcOGI0hU-hzJfnxmfs-UqqV), written while he had cancer
- The film, [*How Do You Live?*/*The Boy and The Heron*](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-boy-and-the-heron/)
- The film, [*Asteroid City*](https://letterboxd.com/film/asteroid-city/)

I hope you never need them in this way. But, if you ever do, I hope there’s something that you can find a comfort in.

> Oh, every night I ask myself
> Am I giving enough?
> Am I giving enough?
> Am I giving enough?
> Am I?
