I’m a bit unusual in how attentively I track the music that I listen to. I’ve been using [LastFM](https://www.last.fm/user/dueckjon) for over a decade, I keep a shared Google Sheet with a few friends tracking the albums we listen to each year, and I enjoy contributing to [Musicbrainz](https://musicbrainz.org). I also publicly track [the books I read](https://www.goodreads.com/jondueck), and [the movies that I watch](https://letterboxd.com/jondueck). It‘s how my brain is wired. [Mattias Hinderson](https://hinderson.com)’s new website, [Record Club](https://record.club) is perfect [for me](https://record.club/jd) then. I got an early invite, and since I already had my last few years of albums and ratings already in Google Sheets, I brought some of that in with me.

They have a [great FAQ section](https://record.club/about/faq), but the simple comparison is that it’s much closer to Letterboxd or Goodreads than LastFM. You can mark albums as played, add them to your queue (your to-listen list), and highlight current favourites as “in rotation”. When you add an unreleased album to your queue, you’ll recieve a notification when it’s released. [Every Friday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Release_Day), Record Club sends a personalised email with all new of the releases from your queue, or artists and labels that you follow. In that way, it’s a complement to LastFM rather than a competitor. I can see this approach working for people who don’t need a track-by-track log of their history.

The reviews feature makes me want to get better at writing down my impressions of albums. I’ve already found some new music because I read an intriguing review by a user. Record Club also has a lists feature. I’ve added a few lists from [my annual year-end lists](https://record.club/jd/lists/2023-albums-of-the-year) that I publish here, and I have an ongoing list tracking [albums I’m thinking about for my albums of the year this year](https://record.club/jd/lists/2024-shortlist).

One of my gripes with modern music streaming services (RIP [Rdio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rdio)) is that there’s no way to explore record labels, so I like that it’s an important way for exploring here.

The site uses data from Musicbrainz, so the release information is robust. If anything is missing it can be added to Musicbrainz. (Record Club serves as a beautiful read-only Musicbrainz client.)

Considering that it’s still in closed beta and is being built by a very small team, everything is impressively polished. Almost every feature that I could imagine is already there and working. I particularly like one small detail when you hover over an album. If you’ve listened to the album, the border highlight is purple, when it's in your queue it's orange, and when it’s in your rotation it’s an animated kaleidoscope. Perhaps best of all, they claim “[we do not collect any personal information about you.](https://record.club/about/faq)”

When I first signed up I wasn’t sure if it would be too much work on top of the leisure of listening to music, but it’s become a part of my listening habit. It’s the easiest way to maintain a list of what I have listened to, and what I want to get to.

I still have two invites, so if you’re interested in trying it for yourself, [contact me](/elsewhere). You don’t even need to be as obsessive about tracking media intake to get something out of it.
