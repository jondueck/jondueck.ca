I primarily listen to music via Spotify (even when I own the music), but this year I trialled Apple Music for a bit as well. That meant that my Spotify Wrapped wasn’t quite right. Thanks to [Last.fm (which just turned 20)](https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/22/23473358/lastfm-discord-bot-neil-young-spotify), I’ve compiled my own version.

I listened to [431 different artists](https://www.last.fm/user/dueckjon/library/artists?from=2022-01-01&to=2022-12-31), 672 different albums, and [2089 different songs](https://www.last.fm/user/dueckjon/library/tracks?from=2022-01-01&to=2022-12-31) for a total of [4471 plays](https://www.last.fm/user/dueckjon/library?from=2022-01-01&to=2022-12-31), [down 33% from last year](https://www.last.fm/user/dueckjon/listening-report/year).

I’ve ordered my most-played lists by playtime. I think is the same way that Spotify orders their lists, and probably a better weighting than pure track plays. A big thanks to Patrick McDonough’s [last.timer](https://pmcdonough8133.github.io/last.timer/) tool for helping me to easily compile these lists. Time shown is in hours.
