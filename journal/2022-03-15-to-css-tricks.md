Today, [Chris Coyier announced that CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/css-tricks-is-joining-digitalocean/) has been acquired by DigitalOcean. It’s hard to describe how valuable CSS-Tricks has been for me, and probably anyone else who has written any amount of front-end code.

CSS-Tricks was a constant source of learning when I was starting with CSS, HTML, and Wordpress, but it has remained a constant resource to this very day. The writing was always clear for a beginner to understand, concise enough to refer back to, and written with enough character to always make it an enjoyable read. To me, it represents the very best of the web.

As [Robin Rendle put it in _An Ode to CSS-Tricks_](https://www.robinrendle.com/notes/an-ode-to-css-tricks/),
> Whenever I’ve been stuck on a front-end problem or whenever I hit a snag with something, there is an almost 100% chance that Chris would’ve already written about the problem and the 18 different solutions to it.

After 15 years of running the site, Chris deserves to pass it off. I’m generally sceptical when publically-traded tech companies acquire small indie companies, especially those that have always been so close to their community, but I trust that Christ would leave it in good hands.

I wish Chris and the team all the best.

(CSS-Tricks is so important to me that I’ve revived the blog portion of my website.)

<!-- [Envato did a lovely video about Chris in 2015](https://youtu.be/kRmbVOI6oIM) that captures his passion well – at least to this stranger. -->
