As you may know, I have a fun little podcast called Whatevertown that I make with some friends. It's a silly little show about whatever we find interesting on a given week, but it's been a fun side project. It's pushed me creatively, as a host, with accompanying graphic design and music, and with web development.

Early on into the planning of the show, I knew I wanted to try to use Jekyll for the website. We were looking for ways to keep production costs down, and if we had our GitHub repo public, my co-hosts could use Siteleaf for managing the site for free. I've used Siteleaf on a number of websites, including this very one at time of publishing. It's simple to set up, and quick for users to get a grasp of. Wordpress could have worked for publishing as well, but it felt over-powered for our needs.

## Step 1 – Audio
Obviously the most important step is the audio.

## Step 2 – The Feed
Like I said up top, I wanted to try to build the feed in Jekyll.
