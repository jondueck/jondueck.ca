## Get offscreen
Not [the magazine](https://offscreenmag.com), but that's good too. The trouble with trying to break through creative block on a computer is that it can be hard to distinguish between digital sketching, and production-level work. The curves are too perfect, the text too right. You can get held up on letterspacing, or stroke weight.

## Separate "inspiration" and project moodboards
I keep a general, ongoing moodboard and then tag specific industries, media, etc

## Do something else
If you're not on a tight deadline, try something else.

## Go to the extremes
Try the simplest version of the piece. Then try the most extreme, fun version that you wouldn't even present to a client. These pieces might not be usable, but they get you thinking about the solutions and aesthetics in a different way.
