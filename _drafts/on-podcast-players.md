<!-- Even though ad breaks are numerous, and [a genre of joke to themselves](https://youtu.be/4YEmeXsknE4), podcasts are a realm that still comes across as more for the love than the money. -->
I listen to a lot of [podcasts](/podcasts/) and so podcatchers are some of my most-used apps. I've tried a number of them in search of the right one, but each one I've tried has at least something missing. Currently I'm using [Overcast](https://overcast.fm), but I'm also interested in [Castro](https://castro.fm), [Apple Podcasts](https://www.apple.com/ca/itunes/podcasts/), and Spotify.

## Mark as Played
With years of podcasts behind me, it's important for me to be able to mark an episode as played without having to play through it in the podcatcher. This is an especially important feature when moving to a new podcatcher. Overcast has this, but it's tough to see which episodes you've "Recommended". This has been a bbig hindrance for me with trying Castro more. Losing my record of which episodes I have and haven't listened to in a show's back catalogue is too much of a hassle.

## Favourites
Sometimes it's nice to revisit favourite episode, or to be able to find an episode to recommend in a pinch. Overcast has "Recommendations", but there's no easy way to find them without going through each podcast and looking for a starred episode. Castro does this well with a playlist of all favourites. Breaker shows all "likes" on your profile page. Stitcher kind of has it.

## Light Social Features
Like music, it's nice to know what friends are listening to without them having to recommend it in person. I don't need – and don't want – to be able to see a live look at what they're listening to, or all of their episodes, but it would be nice to see each others favourites/recommendations/etc. Breaker does too much of this, letting you see all episodes. Overcast lets you see recommendations from people you follow on Twitter, but only in a single feed, so you cant't follow specific people, or see recommendations from specific people.

## Sharing Audio Clips
This isn't critical, but it is nice to be able to share a funny bit or interesting audio clip with a friend.

## Cross-platform
Ideally, I can listen via iPhone, or on my Mac. Spotify and Apple Podcasts are strong here. Overcast sort of works with a web browser player, or using the unofficial app Fog, but episodes don't get marked as played properly through these channels, and some of the smart speed and EQ features don't work outside of the iOS app. Castro doesn't have any Mac options.

## Other Features I like
I really like Overcast's Smart Speed feature which shortens silences. It's more natural than just the ability to speed up the audio. Overcast claims to have saved me over 180 hours of listening thanks to the Smart Speed feature which is, frankly, frightening. Custom audio features per show is nice too.

Are there other features that are important to you that I should include? Or podcatchers that cover all of my requests? [Let me know on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jondueck).
