Last year, my sister – a library technician – and I recommended 3 book to each other to read over the course of the year. I found it to be a good experiment that pushed me to read things I might not have normally read.

| *Dark Matter* by Blake Crouch | *And Then There Were None* by Agatha Christie |

After a successful experiment last year, we've decided to do it again this year.
