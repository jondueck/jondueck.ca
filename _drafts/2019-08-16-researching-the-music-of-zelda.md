For our recently-released project with [https://whatevertown.com/whatevertales](Whatevertown), we needed some original scoring, and I was looking forward to the challenge. One of the co-hosts, Tim, and I have made electronic music for the show before, but usually short fun sketches that we make out of the context of the show that gets used as transition music. This was our first project working music directly tied to the content of the show.
