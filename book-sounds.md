When reading a new book, I like making an instrumental playlist that fits the vibe of the book. Here are a few I've made:

- [*Annihilation* by Jeff Vandermeer](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/13fzC17V9GN19SSCwvIyrL?si=2S8zFS7rQKGZcdg-Il0qag)
- [*Dark Matter* by Blake Crouch](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7BgSWtQEDKzh8Q5fBBrFqj?si=rxe1S9wuQEa0qEN4sFcu7g)
